      "Ted Mosby, an architect, recounts to his children the events that led him to meet their mother. His journey is made more eventful by the presence of his friends Lily, Marshall, Robin and Barney.",

    Storyline: `Very few shows in history have gone through the sort of ups and downs in general consensus that How I Met Your Mother endured. Across its nine seasons and beyond, it's gone from cultishly adored to critically beloved to widely derided to cartoonishly outdated.

    It produced one of the most divisive final seasons in recent memory, lingering far too long on a tortured plotline and then rushing the subplot that was the show's raison d'etre. Until Game of Thrones fell through the Red Keep floor trying to stick the landing, HIMYM was a strong contender for the worst finale of the 2000s. And ongoing dialogues about the way women are treated by lecherous and predatory men make one of the show's central characters nigh indefensible. As such, the storyline of HIMYM is something superfans have to keep straight in their heads, knowing that another trip to Ted's apartment might ruin their previous enjoyment of the series.
    
    It can be hard to remember how HIMYM became such a sensation and the way some of its jokes entered our cultural lexicon. If you want to remember why we all cared so much about sad sack Ted Mosby in the first place — and if you want to see why the finale generated so much outrage — we've got you covered. Here's the entire How I Met Your Mother timeline explained.

      "The series revolves around Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg), a talented but immature NYPD detective in Brooklyn's fictional 99th Precinct, who often comes into conflict with his commanding officer, the serious and stern Captain Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher)",

    Storyline: [
      `Getting into the NBC police comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine doesn't take a lot of background. Plot-wise, it isn't exactly Westworld. All you really need to know is the sitcom features the exploits of a precinct of police officers who are absolute super cops in some ways and bumbling morons in others.  
  
      But that doesn't mean there isn't a lot to be gained from knowing more about the background of these well-meaning yet flawed detectives. For invested fans of the series, the return of some of the beloved recurring characters — whether they're dangerously traumatized undercover cops or chest-pounding parasites who swoop in occasionally to steal the squad's glory — add a lot of flavor to the show. And when you hear Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) innocently oversexualize another turn of phrase or watch Terry (Terry Crews) go ballistic over yogurt, it's that much funnier when you know it's something they do just about every episode. 
      
      Whether you're a new fan or you've been there from the beginning and just enjoy hearing about your favorite dysfunctional police squad, here's the timeline of Brooklyn Nine-Nine explained.`,

    about_Show:
      "Naruto Uzumaki, is a loud, hyperactive, adolescent ninja who constantly searches for approval and recognition, as well as to become Hokage, who is acknowledged as the leader and strongest of all ninja in the village",

    Storyline: `It's not quite as sprawling as laughably long animated series like One Piece, but jumping into the world of Naruto at this point is still quite a daunting task.

     The long-running and beloved show, based on Masashi Kishimoto's manga of the same name, follows a young ninja named Naruto Uzumaki as he navigates a world built around mystical control of in-born, elemental abilities. It takes long enough to tell the story of his training in these arts that many of the young fans of the show age right along with him.
     
     The show is split into two separate storylines: the original Naruto following the young ninja-in-training as a child, and Naruto: Shippuden picking up with his later exploits as a teenager. While you might think this would make it easier to digest, the two shows come to a whopping 720 episodes between them. To give you a better idea of scale, the Adult Swim anime block Toonami began airing Shippuden's 500 episodes on a weekly basis in 2014. They are scheduled to finally wrap the series in 2024.
     
     Before you get discouraged by the massive pile of cartoon ninja-related homework, let us walk you through the world of the series. You'd be hard-pressed to find any story that needs 720 episodes to wrap itself up, but that doesn't mean the eventual tale told by Naruto isn't worth a bit of investment.

    Storyline: `Teenagers may not be able to make poor romantic decisions in real-life high school right now, but that doesn't mean they can't enjoy poor decision-making vicariously through the power of film. This week sees the release of the sequel to Netflix's successful teen romcom The Kissing Booth. Much like the original, The Kissing Booth 2 features Elle Evans (Joey King) struggling with the relative merits of dating Noah Flynn (Jacob Elordi).

      Whereas the original film saw Elle struggle with whether or not it was okay to date her best friend Lee's (Joel Courtney) brother, The Kissing Booth 2 focuses on a topic that's a lot more relatable to most people, teens and adults alike: Can a long-distance relationship work? At the close of The Kissing Booth, Elle and Noah were together, but Noah was on his way to Harvard. The Kissing Booth 2 picks up immediately after the events of that film, and takes us past the "will they or won't they" to "can these crazy kids make it work when they're hundreds of miles away from each other?"
      
      Are Elle and Noah still together by the end of The Kissing Booth 2? What does Elle lie about and what is the truth? Are there real-world elements that impact where this love story went so far, and where it might go next? Here's a full explanation for the ending of The Kissing Booth 2.

    about_Show:
      "When two children go missing in a small German town, its sinful past is exposed along with the double lives and fractured relationships that exist among four families as they search for the kids. The mystery-drama series introduces an intricate puzzle filled with twists that includes a web of curious characters, all of whom have a connection to the town's troubled history -- whether they know it or not. The story includes supernatural elements that tie back to the same town in 1986",

    Storyline: `Jonas and Martha aren't the only people who have been navigating the various time streams to further their own agendas. Elderly Claudia (Lisa Kreuzer) is also on the hunt for a timeline or universe in which her daughter, Regina (Deborah Kaufmann) isn't dead. After spending enough time in Adam and Eva's worlds, and seeing Regina die in both, she realizes something: the knot doesn't exist in either world, but rather it derives from an entirely different third world.

      As it turns out, both Adam and Eva's worlds were created by an event in this World Three, which is actually the original world. That's right — Worlds One and Two are just aberrations created by a time paradox in World Three.
      
      The event in question happened in 1986, when clockmaker H.G. Tannhaus (Arnd Klawitter) created a time machine in an attempt to save his son, his daughter-in-law, and granddaughter from dying in a car crash. The crash in question happened years earlier, after Tannhaus and his son had a huge fight. After the row, his son took his family and drove off into the night, where he lost control of the car and plunged off a bridge.
      
      When Tannhaus was finally able to create his time machine, its deployment spontaneously generated the worlds of Adam and Eva.

      "This thrilling Netflix original drama stars Golden Globe-winning actress Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers, who lives in a small Indiana town in 1983 -- inspired by a time when tales of science fiction captivated audiences. When Joyce's 12-year-old son, Will, goes missing, she launches a terrifying investigation into his disappearance with local authorities. As they search for answers, they unravel a series of extraordinary mysteries involving secret government experiments, unnerving supernatural forces, and a very unusual little girl.",

    Storyline: `Netflix's science fiction/horror series Stranger Things took audiences by storm in the summer of 2016 with its mix of 1980s nostalgia, an endearing ensemble cast, and an engrossing mystery within a small Indiana town turned upside down. Writer-directors the Duffer brothers created the series as a "love letter" to the genre stories of Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, and Stephen King — but as critics noted, this entertaining show wasn't "just another example of dutiful, uninspired imitation run amok." 

    Like the alternate dimension unleashed upon the fictional town of Hawkins, Stranger Things had more in mind than simply plotting out the next jump scare, even with monsters as riveting as the petal-headed Demogorgon. "[I]t is primarily interested in watching believably flawed people wrestle with the idea that some things are unknowable, and that having 'answers' doesn't necessarily prevent the arrival of pain and confusion," as Variety wrote. Rather, "hard-won connections with other human beings can be a balm in a sea of confusion." 
    
    Through three seasons, the show has become a pop culture phenomenon inspiring everything from Halloween costumes to ice cream -– and raking in awards for its ensemble cast, music, and editing. The American Film Institute in 2018 named it one of the Television Programs of the Year. Although this series is eminently binge-worthy, there are some moments we watch and pause more than others, usually related to characters that audiences have grown to love. Here are our picks for the most paused moments in Stranger Things.

      "A criminal mastermind who goes by The Professor has a plan to pull off the biggest heist in recorded history -- to print billions of euros in the Royal Mint of Spain. To help him carry out the ambitious plan, he recruits eight people with certain abilities and who have nothing to lose. The group of thieves take hostages to aid in their negotiations with the authorities, who strategize to come up with a way to capture The Professor. As more time elapses, the robbers prepare for a showdown with the police.",

    Storyline: `If you're a Netflix viewer who's not cowed by what Parasite director Bong Joon-ho called "the one-inch-tall barrier" of subtitles, then you're likely clued in to one of the most thrilling crime dramas currently available on television: La Casa de Papel, or Money Heist, as it's known in the English-speaking world. The Spanish series has gripped a global audience with its complex, nuanced characters, its twisting plots, and its sense of structural style over three seasons, spending six weeks as Netflix's most-followed series.

      Part 4, which arrived on April 3, 2020, has proven no exception. Picking up right where Part 3's cliffhangers left off, it launches the robbers headlong into an effort to save Nairobi's (Alba Flores) life, while the Professor (Álvaro Morte) and Marseille (Luka Peroš) come to the conclusion that Lisbon (Itziar Ituño) is alive and being interrogated by Sierra (Najwa Nimri). Where it begins, however, is no match for where it ends — with events that rock not only the lives of the characters, but also the larger world they inhabit. In fact, one of the biggest twists might have been missed by even the most eagle-eyed viewer if they navigated away from the credits too quickly.

    Storyline: `The world of Peaky Blinders is unabashedly cool. It starts off with the theme song: Nick Cave's searing murder ballad, "Red Right Hand." Then, there's the Shelby crime family at the center of the story. Their escapades in post-World War I Birmingham are cutthroat to be sure — but they also look cool as all get-out. Sometimes, the show feels like an excuse for Cillian Murphy to rain down hellfire in awesome period coats.

    But the show's writers aren't just in it for the awesomeness. As the show unfolds and the Shelby family gains more and more power, things get knotty. Birmingham was a hotbed of leftist organizing, fascist agitation, and conservative crackdowns, after all. Peaky Blinders doesn't shy away from this complexity: It revels in its tale of crooked capitalists and bloody resistance. As the Shelby family's fortunes shift and the tides of history pull with more ferocity, Peaky Blinders grows ever more complicated and deep. Saboteurs, moles, and outright fanatics abound, and everyone from power-seeking criminals to the officers of the law are out to bring the Shelbys down. We're here to demystify this web of intrigue with this timeline of the entire series.

    about_Show:
      "The lives of four socially awkward friends, Leonard, Sheldon, Howard and Raj, take a wild turn when they meet the beautiful and free-spirited Penny.",
    Storyline: `The Big Bang Theory is one of the most interesting case studies of snobbery versus mass popularity this century. One one hand, the show became an online punching bag for people to signify that their taste in television was more complex than the average viewer. On the other, it was frequently the highest-rated show on television, ran for 12 seasons, and won 10 Emmys.

      The show's harshest critics were wrong. The Big Bang Theory had the misfortune of being an incredibly successful iteration of the tried and true multi-cam sitcom format in a time when Peak TV and innovations in the sitcom form, seen in shows like The Office and Parks & Rec, made some viewers expect more from their 22 minutes. Across its 12 years, The Big Bang Theory never lost sight of what it was, or caved to those outside pressures. It remained, to the very end, a well-oiled machine crafted to deliver jokes about pop culture, relationships and obsessive nerdery. The show knew what it was and it did that very, very well.
      
      Of course, if there was literally no growth across the years, fans would tune out. Similar to its long-running forebears in the sitcom space, the core cast grew and changed (albeit at a slower pace than they would in the real world), providing fans with a satisfying story arc that closed out in 2019.While TBBT never made the story hard to follow, an overview can be helpful. That's why we're running down the story of Leonard, Howard, Raj, Penny and Sheldon for anyone who just wants to take the leap into a random batch of syndicated episodes.

For one thing, it kept the same central cast for its entire run, which most long-running series fail to do. It started with Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe, and they were all still there when it ended. 

    The behind-the-scenes story of Friends has been discussed elsewhere, but we want to talk about the fictional story instead. Who are these six characters, where did they come from, and how did they fit together so well? Their life stories were revealed slowly over the course of those ten seasons, so let's piece it together, character by character, and examine the full story of Friends.`,

      "A motley group of office workers go through hilarious misadventures at the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.",
    Storyline: `NBC's smash hit sitcom The Office captivated audiences as it unfolded in a nine-season run from 2005 to 2013. During that eight-year stretch, the simple premise of the series — documenting life in a typical American workspace — grew into a massive story with numerous twists, subplots, romances, and side characters. When all was said and done, the show boasted a combined 188 episodes, all filled to the brink with storytelling at its finest. 

    The truth is, though, while this gigantic pile of entertainment is incredibly fun to binge over and over again, it can be a bit difficult to follow the greater storyline at times. With so many dynamic personalities co-existing in one tiny office building, it's easy to get lost in the details. So we've gone ahead and mapped things out in a sweet and condensed format in order to finally allow fans to step back and get that 10,000-foot view of what exactly happened during the eight years that America's favorite workplace was under the scrutiny of a PBS documentary crew.

    about_Show:
      "A dangerously charming, intensely obsessive young man goes to extreme measures to insert himself into the lives of those he is transfixed by.",
    Storyline: `Based on Caroline Kepnes' best-selling novel of the same name, YOU is a 21st century love story that asks, "What would you do for love?" When a brilliant bookstore manager crosses paths with an aspiring writer, his answer becomes clear: anything. Using the internet and social media as his tools to gather the most intimate of details and get close to her, a charming and awkward crush quickly becomes obsession as he quietly and strategically removes every obstacle - and person - in his way. Written by ahmetkozan`,
